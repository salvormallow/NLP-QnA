A clever fox invited a stork to dine.  

The fox only served some soup in a flat and large dish.  

The fox lapped the soup with relish.  

The stork attempted to drink some savory broth and failed.  

The fox believed that distress was amusing.  

The stork shortly invited the fox to dine.  

The stork presented the fox with a pitcher.  

The stork easily fitted the long bill of the stork into the long and narrow neck of the pitcher.  

The stork enjoied some dinner.  

The fox began to be hungry and began to be helpless because he wasn't able to reach some food that was in the pitcher.
